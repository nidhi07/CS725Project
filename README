MODELS
Extra Trees Classifier		et.py
Random Forest Classifier	rf.py
XGBoost Classifer		xgboost.py	
Data preprocessing		data_preprocessing.py

HOW TO RUN
Initially all the 5 data files log_feature.csv, event_type.csv, resource_type.csv, severity_type.csv, test.csv, train.csv into a folder called data/. 

Run the data preprocessing as python data_preprocessing.py 

The data preprocessing will create 4 new files- X_train.csv, X_test.csv, y_train.csv, y_test.csv in the data/ folder which are used by the model for fitting and prediction.

Then can test on any model as you wish

python et.py 
This will generate a file et_output.csv

python rf.py
This will generate a file rf_output.csv

python xgboost.py
This will generate a file xgb_output.csv
XGBoost needs to be installed before one can run this file
Install XGBoost using sudo pip install xgboost
